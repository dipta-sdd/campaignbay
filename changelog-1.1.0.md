**February 5, 2026**

We're incredibly excited to announce **CampaignBay 1.1.0**—our biggest update yet! This release represents a complete transformation of the plugin experience. We've rebuilt the entire admin interface from the ground up, focusing on clarity, speed, and modern design principles that make managing your discount campaigns a pleasure.

Whether you're a longtime user or just discovering CampaignBay, this update will make you fall in love with how intuitive and polished a WooCommerce discount plugin can be.

## A Complete UI Redesign

The heart of version 1.1.0 is our **complete visual overhaul**. Every screen, every button, and every interaction has been thoughtfully redesigned.

### What Changed?

We started with a blank canvas and asked ourselves: "What would make store owners genuinely enjoy setting up their campaigns?" The answer led us to rebuild everything.

**Cleaner Visual Hierarchy**  
The new interface uses a refined color palette, improved typography, and generous spacing. Information is easier to scan, actions are clearer to find, and the overall experience feels premium and professional.

**Faster Interactions**  
We've optimized rendering and reduced unnecessary re-draws. Navigating between campaigns, switching tabs in settings, and editing complex promotions all feel snappier than ever.

**Modern Component Library**  
Every form element—from date pickers to dropdown selectors—has been upgraded. The new components are not only more beautiful but also more accessible and easier to use.

## Redesigned Dashboard

Your Campaign Dashboard is where you start each day, so we made it shine.

**Improved Data Visualization**  
Charts and KPI cards have been refined for better readability. At a glance, you can see your active campaigns, total discounts given, and revenue from promotions.

**Clearer Widget Layout**  
The Top Campaigns, Recent Activity, and Upcoming Campaigns widgets now have a more balanced layout that makes critical information pop.

**Responsive Design**  
Whether you're on a large monitor or a laptop, the dashboard adapts beautifully.

## Streamlined Campaign Editor

Creating and editing campaigns is now faster and more intuitive than ever.

**Better Form Layouts**  
Fields are grouped logically, with clear section headers. You'll spend less time hunting for options and more time setting up effective promotions.

**Improved Date & Time Picker**  
The scheduling interface has been enhanced with better visual feedback. Times that fall outside your selected range are now **disabled (grayed out)** rather than hidden—so you always understand exactly what options are available.

**Contextual Help Tooltips**  
We've added inline documentation links throughout the campaign editor. Hover over the info icons next to options like "Exclude Items" or "Usage Limit," and you'll see a quick explanation with a **"Read More"** link that takes you directly to the relevant documentation page. No more guessing what a setting does!

## Refreshed Settings Pages

Plugin configuration is now organized and polished.

**Improved Navigation**  
Move between Global Settings, Product Settings, Cart Settings, and Advanced Settings with clear, intuitive tabs.

**Cleaner Option Groups**  
Settings are now visually separated into logical groups, making it easy to find exactly what you need to configure.

**Updated Documentation Links**  
Every setting references our comprehensive online documentation, so help is always one click away.


---

## Developer & Performance Improvements

Under the hood, we've continued to refine the codebase:

**Optimized Component Rendering**  
The React components powering the admin interface are now more efficient, reducing memory usage and improving responsiveness.

**Better Code Organization**  
We've restructured internal modules for improved maintainability, making it easier for us to ship new features quickly.

**Caching Improvements**  
Behind-the-scenes optimizations ensure your discount calculations remain lightning-fast, even with complex multi-tier promotions.
